  <h3>Learning Snap</h3>

  <p>
    Learning a new web framework is hard. Period.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learning something new places significant demand on your cognitive
    resources, and it takes time to build fluency. Once you get past the
    standard "Hello World" introduction to a new programming technology, you'll
    find a whole ecosystem of abstractions, architecture patterns, libraries,
    conventions, templating languages, database APIs, testing methodologies,
    and deployment options.
  </p>

  <h3>The whole stack</h3>

  <p>
    If you're coming to Haskell from another language, or coming to Haskell web
    development from another domain, it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed
    by all of the layers and components in a typical web stack. And even if
    you've been at it for years, no two frameworks or APIs are the same.
  </p>

  <h3>Learning by example</h3>

  <p>
    Everyone has their own learning style, and in the Haskell community it's
    usually expected that you'll start with first principles and build from
    there. We support that style of learning, but there are already many
    resources out there
    (<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Learning_Haskell">books</a>,
    <a href="http://snapframework.com/docs">framework docs</a>,
    <a href="http://planet.haskell.org/">blogs</a>, etc.) that will set you on
    the right path.
  </p>

  <p>
    What's often missing is a wide range of example cases, presented
    <i>in context</i>, to give you a solid starting point, fully working
    code, and the motivation to keep learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site aims to fill that gap by providing interactive examples with
    inline, viewable source and templating code using Snap, Heist, and the
    digestive-functors library for HTML forms. You can even clone the site from
    its <a href="https://github.com/ericrasmussen/digestive-heist-demos">
    GitHub repo</a> to view, run, and modify the code locally as you learn Snap.
  </p>

  <h3>Leveling up</h3>

  <p>
    Learning Snap will increase your ability to build and maintain web
    applications. Haskell and Snap let you express complex web interactions in a
    small amount of code, prevent whole classes of runtime errors, and cleanly
    separate logic from presentation. This frees you up to focus on what really
    matters: the people using your application.
